# workflows

Shared, reusable GitHub Actions workflows for the `ostendorf-cloud` organisation.

## What it does

Each workflow in `.github/workflows/` is a `workflow_call` reusable workflow a repository in
this organisation references by tag, instead of copying the same job into every repository.

## Use

A consuming repository's own workflow calls one with `uses:`, pinned to a released tag:

```yaml
jobs:
  dco:
    uses: ostendorf-cloud/workflows/.github/workflows/reusable-dco.yaml@v1.0.0
    secrets: inherit
```

Each reusable workflow documents its own required `inputs` and `secrets` in a header comment
above its `on:` block.

Available and planned workflows:

- DCO sign-off check (`reusable-dco.yaml`): fails a pull request carrying a commit without a
  valid Developer Certificate of Origin trailer.
- CodeQL scanning: planned, tracked by its own issue.
- License-header check: planned, tracked by its own issue.
- Self-hosted Renovate: planned, tracked by its own issue.

## Development

```sh
task setup   # mise install, the pinned toolchain
task check   # every check this repository runs in CI, one after another
```

`task --list` shows the individual targets if you want to run just one.
